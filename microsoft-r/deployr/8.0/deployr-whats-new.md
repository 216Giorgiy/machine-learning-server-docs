### Version 7.2 (Enterprise Only)

-   Works with Microsoft R Server 7.2
-   A diagnostic script, which outputs basic details about your environment, identifies any unresponsive components, such as the server itself, grid nodes, databases, and so on, and gathers essential log and configuration files.

### Version 7.1 (Enterprise Only)

-   With this release, RevoDeployR is now called DeployR.

-   Weâ€™ve also introduced the DeployR Repository Manager, which is a tool that simplifies the task of managing repository files. Authenticated DeployR users can use the Repository Manager to manage repository files (R scripts, data files, and so on) as well as interact with their R scripts in a live debugging environment. Note that the script management functionality formerly found in the RevoDeployR Management Console is now contained in the Repository Manager. This tool can be accessed through the DeployR landing page.

-   The Management Console has been renamed to the Administration Console. Other changes to that console include:
    -   The Administration Console can only be accessed by the admin user.
    -   All R script management functionality, other than import and export of R scripts, has been moved to the Repository Manager.
    -   The user testmanager and the role SCRIPT\_MANAGER were obsoleted and removed when script management functionality was moved to the DeployR Repository Manager.
-   There is new and updated API support, including new directory support on the Repository APIs. Refer to the **Change History** section in the **API Reference Guide** for that release for details.

    -   Support for creating pools of temporary projects on the `/r/project/pool` API
    -   New standardized set of parameters across all execution APIs
    -   New R script execution chaining support on all script execution APIs

-   New Event Stream Console, which is a browser-based console window for viewing `/r/event/stream` events. This console is integrated into the management console, the API Explorer tool, and the JavaScript sample applications delivered with RevoDeployR.
-   The management console was updated to include:
    -   The creation and use of custom roles to restrict access to R scripts and event streams
    -   Private, Restricted, Shared and Public access controls for R Scripts
    -   Validation of grid node configurations upon creation, update, and import
