#Microsoft R Client

The following release notes apply to Microsoft R Client.

+ Microsoft R Client is a data science tool that allows you to work with production data locally and produce  high performance analytics using the full set of RevoScaleR functions.  

+ R Client is built on top of Microsoft R Open so you can use any open source R packages to build your analytics. 

+ Additionally, R Client introduces the powerful ScaleR technology and its proprietary functions to benefit from parallelization and remote computing. 

+ R Client is in-memory bound, meaning that it can only process datasets that fit into the available local memory. Processing is also limited to up to two threads for ScaleR functions.

+ With Microsoft R Client, you have the ability to push the compute context to a production instance of Microsoft R Server or work with SQL Server R Services and R Server for Hadoop in order to benefit from disk scalability, greater performance and speed.
