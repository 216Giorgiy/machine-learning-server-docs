#What's New in Microsoft R Client

The following release notes apply to Microsoft R Client, which can be downloaded from http://aka.ms/rclient/download.

+ Microsoft R Client is a free, community-supported, data science tool for building high performance analytics using the full set of ScaleR functions.  

+ R Client is built on top of Microsoft R Open so you can use any open source R packages to build your analytics. 

+ Additionally, R Client introduces the powerful ScaleR technology and its proprietary functions to benefit from parallelization and remote computing. 

+ R Client is in-memory bound, meaning that it can only process datasets that fit into the available local memory. Processing is also limited to up to two threads for ScaleR functions.

+ With Microsoft R Client, you have the ability to push the compute context to a production instance of Microsoft R Server such as [SQL Server R Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt604845.aspx) and R Server for Hadoop in order to benefit from disk scalability, greater performance and speed. 

[See here](../index.md#compare-prods) for a comparison between R Client and R Server.
