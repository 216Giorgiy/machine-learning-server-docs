# Diving into data analysis in Microsoft R

This section is the data science documentation for Microsoft R products and technologies, with focus on data acquisition, transformation and manipulation, visualization and analysis. It includes tutorials as well as guidance for specific tasks.

If you are new to R, be sure to leverage the R Core Team manuals that are part of every R distribution, including *An Introduction to R*, *The R Language Definition*, *Writing R Extensions* and so on. Beyond the standard R manuals, there are many other resources. [Learn about them here](microsoft-r-more-resources.md).
