# Diving into data analysis in Microsoft R

This section of the documentation is for data scientists, analysts, and statisticians. The focus of this section is on data acquisition, transformation and manipulation, visualization, and analysis using Microsoft R products and technologies. It includes tutorials as well as guidance for specific tasks using the ScaleR functions in the  RevoScaleR package.

If you are new to R, be sure to also leverage the R Core Team manuals that are part of every R distribution, including *An Introduction to R*, *The R Language Definition*, *Writing R Extensions* and so on. Beyond the standard R manuals, there are many other resources. [Learn about them here](microsoft-r-more-resources.md).
