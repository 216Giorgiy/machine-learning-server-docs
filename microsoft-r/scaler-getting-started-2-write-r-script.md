## Using ScaleR functions in R script


### Create R Script to transform data

1. Find or open the **R Script** window in your solution.


NOTE: You can add R script to any solution by right-clicking on the project name in the **Solution Explorer**, and choosing **Add** > **Existing Item**.

## Demo scripts

Another way to learn about ScaleR is through demo scripts. Scripts provided in your Microsoft R installation contain code that's very similar to what you see in this tutorial. These scripts are located in the *demoScripts* subdirectory of your Microsoft R installation. On Windows, this is typically:

	`C:\Program Files\Microsoft\R Client\R_SERVER\library\RevoScaleR\demoScripts`
