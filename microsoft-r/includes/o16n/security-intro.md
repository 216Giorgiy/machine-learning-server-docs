You can configure Microsoft R Server to add further enterprise security features around the operationalization feature such as:
+ Seamless integrations with [authentication](../../operationalize/security-authentication.md) options: Active Directory LDAP/LDAP-Security or Azure Active Directory

+ Secured connections using [HTTPS](../../operationalize/security-https.md). For security reasons, we strongly recommend that HTTPS be enabled in **all production environments.** 

+ [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](../../operationalize/security-cors.md) to allow restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the originating domain.

Additionally, we recommend that you review the following [RServe Security Considerations](../../operationalize/security-rserve.md).
