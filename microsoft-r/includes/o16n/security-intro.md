You can configure DeployR to take advantage of enterprise-ready security features such as:
+ [Authentication](../../operationalize/security-authentication.md) with Active Directory LDAP/LDAP-Security or with Azure Active Directory

+ [HTTPS](../../operationalize/security-https.md) configuration to secure communication

+ [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](../../operationalize/security-cors.md) to allow restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the originating domain.

   >For security reasons, we strongly recommend that HTTPS be enabled in **all production environments.**  Since we cannot ship certificates for you, HTTPS protocols are disabled by default.
