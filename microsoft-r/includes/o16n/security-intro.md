You can add greater enterprise security around Microsoft R Server's operationalization feature such as:
+ Seamless integrations with Active Directory LDAP/LDAP-Security or Azure Active Directory [authentication](../../operationalize/security-authentication.md).

+ Secured connections using [SSL/TLS 1.2](../../operationalize/security-https.md). For security reasons, we strongly recommend that SSL/TLS 1.2 be enabled in **all production environments.** 

+ [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](../../operationalize/security-cors.md) to allow restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the originating domain.

Additionally, we recommend that you review the following [Security Considerations](../../operationalize/security-rserve.md).
