Configure DeployR to take advantage of enterprise-ready security features such as:
+ [Authenticating](security-authentication.md) with Active Directory LDAP/LDAP-Security or with Azure Active Directory
+ [Using HTTPS](security-https.md) to secure communication
+ [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](security-cors.md) to allow restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the originating domain.

>[!IMPORTANT] 
>For security reasons, we strongly recommend that HTTPS be enabled in **all production environments.**  Since we cannot ship certificates for you, HTTPS protocols are disabled by default.
