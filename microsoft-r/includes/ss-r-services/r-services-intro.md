SQL Server R Services provides a platform for developing intelligent applications that uncover new insights. You can use the rich and powerful R language and the many open source packages to create models and generate predictions using your SQL Server data. 

SQL Server R Services is an installation of R that runs alongside SQL Server (operating as a SQL Server service) and communicates securely with SQL Server.  During the installation process, Microsoft R Open and ScaleR libraries are installed onto SQL Server so that you can integrate your server data wth SQL Server and Microsoft’s BI tools. Because SQL Server R Services integrates the R language with SQL Server, you can keep analytics close to the data and eliminate the costs and security risks associated with data movement.

SQL Server R Services combines R with a comprehensive set of SQL Server tools and technologies that offer superior performance, security, reliability and manageability. You can deploy R solutions using convenient, familiar tools, and your production applications can call the R runtime and retrieve predictions and visuals using Transact-SQL. With Enterprise Edition, you also get the ScaleR libraries to overcome R’s inherent performance and scale limitations.
