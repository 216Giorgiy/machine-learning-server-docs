SQL Server R Services provides a platform for developing intelligent applications that uncover new insights. You can use the rich and powerful R language and the many open source packages to create models and generate predictions using your SQL Server data. Because SQL Server R Services integrates the R language with SQL Server, you can keep analytics close to the data and eliminate the costs and security risks associated with data movement.

SQL Server R Services combines R with a comprehensive set of SQL Server tools and technologies that offer superior performance, security, reliability and manageability. You can deploy R solutions using convenient, familiar tools, and your production applications can call the R runtime and retrieve predictions and visuals using Transact-SQL. With Enterprise Edition, you also get the ScaleR libraries to overcome Râ€™s inherent performance and scale limitations.
