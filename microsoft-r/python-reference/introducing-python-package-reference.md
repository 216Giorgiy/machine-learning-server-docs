# Python function help

**Applies to: SQL Server 2017 RC1**

This section contains the reference documentation for two proprietary Python packages installed with SQL Server Machine Learning Services and SQL Server Machine Learning Server (Standalone) in the SQL Server 2017 RC1 release.

|Package | Description |
|----|----|
|[microsoftml](microsoftml/index.md)|A collection of Python functions used for machine learning use cases. |
|[revoscalepy](revoscalepy/index.md) | Data access, manipulation and transformations, visualization, and analysis. The revoscalepy functions support a broad spectrum of statistical and analytical tasks. Developers who are familiar with Microsoft R Server and the RevoScaleR package will see notable similarities in the functions provided in revoscalepy. Conceptually, revoscalepy is the Python equivalent of the Microsoft R RevoScaleR package.|
