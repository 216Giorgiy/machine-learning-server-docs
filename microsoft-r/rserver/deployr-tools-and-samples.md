# Developer Documentation & Downloads

>**Get Started with DeployR!**  
>Use the **RBroker framework** and/or the **client libraries** to communicate with the DeployR server. On this page, you can download the framework/library in one of the available languages, follow their tutorials, and consult the comprehensive documentation.

## RBroker Framework

The RBroker Framework provides a simple yet powerful API that supports the rapid integration of R Analytics inside any Java, JavaScript, or .NET application. Simply define an RTask, submit your task to an instance of RBroker and then retrieve your RTaskResult. It really is that simple.

1.   Read the RBroker [Tutorial](deployr-rbroker-framework.md)

2.   Continue with your preferred programming language:
	- Java
		- [API Documentation](http://microsoft.github.io/java-rbroker-framework/)
		- [Download Framework from GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/java-rbroker-framework/releases)  
	- JavaScript
		- [API Documentation](https://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com/documents/dev/rbroker-jsdoc)
		- [Download Framework from GitHub ](https://github.com/deployr/js-rbroker-framework/releases) 
	- .NET
		- [API Documentation](https://github.com/deployr/dotnet-rbroker-framework/releases)
		- [Download Framework from GitHub](https://github.com/deployr/dotnet-rbroker-framework/releases)  

3.  Explore the RBroker Framework examples for [Java](https://github.com/deployr/java-example-rbroker-basics), [JavaScript](https://github.com/deployr/js-rbroker-framework), and [.NET](https://github.com/deployr/dotnet-rbroker-framework). Find them under the `examples` directory of each Github repository.

4.  Check out additional [sample applications](http://github.com/deployr?query=example) that use the RBroker Framework.

## Client Libraries

The DeployR API exposes a wide range of R analytics services to client application developers. To simplify the integration of DeployR services within client applications, several client libraries are provided for Java, JavaScript and .NET developers.

1.  Read the Client Library [Tutorial](deployr-client-library.md)

2.  Continue with your preferred programming language:

	-  Java
		-  [API Documentation](http://microsoft.github.io/java-client-library/)
		-  [Download Library from GitHub](https://github.com/deployr/java-client-library/releases)
	-  JavaScript
		-  [API Documentation](https://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com/documents/dev/client-jsdoc)
		-  [Download Library from GitHub](https://github.com/deployr/js-client-library/releases)
	-  .NET
		-  [Download API Documentation](https://github.com/deployr/dotnet-client-library/releases)
		-  [Download Library from GitHub](https://github.com/deployr/dotnet-client-library/releases)

3.
