# Developer Tools, API Docs, and Samples

>**Get Started with DeployR!**  
>Use the [**RBroker framework**](deployr-rbroker-framework.md) and/or the [**client libraries**](deployr-client-library.md) to communicate with the DeployR server. On this page, you can download the framework/library in one of the available languages, follow their tutorials, and consult the comprehensive documentation.

## RBroker Framework

The RBroker Framework provides a simple yet powerful API that supports the rapid integration of R Analytics inside any Java, JavaScript, or .NET application. Simply define an RTask, submit your task to an instance of RBroker and then retrieve your RTaskResult. It really is that simple.

## Client Libraries

The DeployR API exposes a wide range of R analytics services to client application developers. To simplify the integration of DeployR services within client applications, several client libraries are provided for Java, JavaScript and .NET developers.
