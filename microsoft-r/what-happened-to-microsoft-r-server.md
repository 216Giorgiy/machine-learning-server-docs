# What happened to Microsoft R Server?

Microsoft R Server has been rebranding to Machine Learning Server in release 9.2 to reflect that Python has now joined R in our list of supported languages. We've added a series of proprietary libraries and tools for Python to complement our R offering. There has been no loss of functionality for R users.

[Read more about what's new in this release](something.md).

## Our committment to R is unchanged

Microsoft continues its commitment to R in the latest Machine Learning Server release as well as [Microsoft R Client](something.md), and [Microsoft R Open](https://mran.microsoft.com).

## Upgrade to Machine Learning Server

Upgrading from R Server to Machine Learning Server is as easy as ever. The R analytics and web services you developed under R Server will continue to work under Machine Learning Server.

Follow these instructions to upgrade to Machine Learning Server on [Windows](something.md), [Linux](something.md), and [Hadoop](something.md). 

Don't forget to [upgrade your web and compute nodes]() if you are operationalizing your analytics.


Microsoft R Server 9.1 for Teradata was the last release and will not have a Machine Learning Server equivalent.

## Download prior R Server releases

You can continue to download older versions of Microsoft R Server from here:

Find the installation instructions for those releases [here](something.md). 

## Get support for R Server

Microsoft is committed to providing customers with support. Microsoft R Server support continues in these ways: 
+ [Review our servicing support timeline](resources-servicing-support.md)

+ [Post in our user forum](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=MicrosoftR)  

## Future of Microsoft R Client

[Microsoft R Client](r-client/what-is-microsoft-r-client.md) has not been rebranded. R Client continues as an R-only client for Machine Learning Server and R Server. 

A Python interpreter can also be installed locally along with the custom Python libraries to gain similar functionality with Python for Machine Learning Server. [Learn more](something.md)
