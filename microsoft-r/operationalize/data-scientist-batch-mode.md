# Asynchronous service consumption via batch processing

**Applies to:  Microsoft R Server 9.1**

The typical approach to consuming web services, ["Request Response" consumption](data-scientist-manage-services.md#consume-service), involves a single API call to execute the code in that web service once. In this article, you'll learn how to perform "Asynchronous Batch" consumption. The Asynchronous Batch approach involves the execution of code without manual intervention using multiple asynchronous API calls on a specific web service sent as a single request to R Server. Then, R Server will immediately execute those operations once for every row of data provided. 



## Asynchronous batch workflow

Generally speaking, the process for asynchronous batch consumption of a web service involves the following:
1. Call the web service on which the batch execution should be run
1. Define the data records for the batch execution task
1. Start (or cancel) the batch execution task
1. Monitor task and interact with results

Use these following [public API functions](data-scientist-manage-services.md#api-client-batch)  to define, start, and interact with your batch executions.

**End-to-end workflow example**

For a quick review of the end-to-end workflow for asynchronous batch executions of web services, check out this example. 

Here we use the `mtService` web service that was published using the example in the [Get Started for Data Scientist](data-scientist-get-started.md) article. 

```R
##########################################################################
#            Perform Batch Consumption & Get Swagger in R                #
##########################################################################

# Use `remoteLogin` to authenticate with R Server using the local admin 
# account. Use session = false so no remote R session started
remoteLogin("http://localhost:12800", 
            username = "admin", 
            password = "{{YOUR_PASSWORD}}",
            session = FALSE)
   
# Get the service using `getService()` function from `mrsdeploy`
# Assign service to the variable `txService`.
txService <- getService("mtService", "v1.0.0")

# Define the record data for the batch execution task.  Record data comes 
# from a data.frame called mtcars. Note: mtcars is a data.frame of 
# 11 cols with names (mpg, cyl, ..., carb) and 32 rows of numerics. 
# Assign to the batch object called 'txBatch'.
record <- mtcars
txBatch <- txService$batch(records) 

# Set thread count using parallelCount. Default is 10.
# txBatch <- txService$batch(records, parallelCount = 5) 

# Start the batch task
txBatch$start()

# Get the task id to reference during or after its execution:
id <- txBatch$id()

# If you need to cancel the batch execution, try this:
# txBatch$cancel()

# Monitor batch execution results with results().
# Check results every 3 seconds until task finishes or fails. 
# Assign returned results to batch result object we called 'batchres'.
batchRes <- NULL
while(TRUE) {
   batchRes <- txBatch$results()

   if (batchRes$status == txBatch$STATUS$failed) { stop("Batch execution failed") } 
   if (batchRes$status == txBatch$STATUS$complete) { break }
      
   Sys.sleep(3)
}
      
# Once the batch task is complete, get the execution records by index from 
# the batch results object, 'batchRes'. This object is the service output.

# For every record, return these results (totalItemCount = # of data records)
for(i in seq(batchRes$totalItemCount)) {

   #1. List of every file that was generated by this execution index.
       files <- txBatch$listFiles(i)
    
   #2. Display the file contents of each file returned in the above list.
       for (fileName in files) {
          content <- txBatch$fileContent(i, fileName)
          if (is.null(content)) { stop("Unable to get file") }
       }
 
   #3. Download files from execution index to the current working directory  
       # unless a dest = "<path>" is specified.

       # Download of a single named file
       txBatch$download(i, "HistogramFile.png")

       # Download of all files
       txBatch$download(i, dest = getwd())
   
   #4. Get results for a given index row returned as an array 
       # assign it to 'exe' and output a data frame for each row. 
       exe <- batchRes$execution(i)
       singleRowDataFrame <- exe$outputParameters$output
}
```

## Public functions for batch

You can use the following supported public functions to consume a service asynchronously.

**Batch functions performed on the service object**

Once you get the service object, use these public functions on that object.

| Function      | Description                                            |Reference|
| ------------- |--------------------------------------------------------|:-----:|
| `batch` |Define the data records to be batched and the thread count|[view](#batch-function)|
| `getBatchExecutions` |Get the list of batch execution identifiers |[view](#findbatch-fx)|
| `getBatch` |Get batch object using its unique execution identifier |[view](#listids-fx)|


**Batch functions performed on the batch object**

Once you have the batch object, use these public functions to interact with it.

| Function      | Description                                            |Reference|
| ------------- |--------------------------------------------------------|:-----:|
| `start` |Starts the execution of a batch scoring operation |[view](#start-fx)|
| `cancel` |Cancel the named batch execution|[view](#cancel-fx)|
| `id` |Get the execution identifier for the named batch process|[view](#id-fx)|
| `STATUS` |Poll for the status of the batch execution (failed, complete, ...)|[view](#results-fx)|
| `results` |Poll for batch execution results, partial or full results as defined|[view](#results-fx)|
| `execution` |Get results for a given index row returned as an array  |[view](#exe-fx)|
| `listFiles` |List of every file that was generated by this execution index  |[view](#listfiles-fx)|
| `fileContent` |Print the contents of the named file generated by the batch execution  |[view](#filecontent-fx)|
| `download` |Download one or all files from execution index|[view](#download-fx)|


## 1. Get the web service

Once you have authenticated (see workflow example), you can retrieve the web service from R Server, assign it to a variable, and define the inputs to it as record data in a data frame (or CSV, TSV, ...). 

Batching begins by retrieving the web service containing the code against which you'll score the data records you define next. You can get a service using its name and version with the `getService()` function from `mrsdeploy`. The result is a service object, which in our example is called `txService`.  

The `getService` function is covered in detail in [this article](data-scientist-manage-services.md). 

**Syntax:** `getService("<serviceName>", "<version>")`

**Example:**
```R   
txService <- getService("mtService", "v1.0.0")
```

<a name="batch-function"></a>

## 2. Define the data records to be batched

Next, use the public api function `batch` to define the input record data for the batch and set the number of concurrent threads for processing. 

**Syntax:** `batch(inputs, parallelCount = 10)`

|Argument|Description|
|----|----|
|`inputs`|Specify the R data.frame name directly, or specify a flat list filename and convert it to a data.frame using the base R function, `read.csv`. |
|`parallelCount`|Default value is 10. Specify the number of concurrent threads that can be dedicated to processing records in the batch. Take care not to set a number so high that it negatively impacts performance.|

**Returns:** The batch object

**Example:**
```R
# INPUTS = data.frame
# Use mtcars data.frame as input. Assign to batch object 'txBatch'.
# Reduce thread count to 5.
txBatch <- myService$batch(mtcars, parallelCount = 5)

# INPUT = Flat CSV converted to a data.frame using read.csv 
# Assign data.frame to 'records' variable. Then, use 'records' as input.
records <- read.csv("mtcars.csv")
txBatch  <- myService$batch(records, parallelCount = 15)
      
# INPUT = TSV file converted to a data.frame using read.csv 
# Declare the separator
records <- read.csv("mtcars.tsv", sep = "\t")
txBatch  <- myService$batch(records)
```

## 3. Start, find, or cancel the batch execution

Next, use the public api functions to start the asynchronous batch execution on the batch object, monitor the execution, or even cancel it.

<a name="start-fx"></a>

### Start batch execution task
Start the batch task with `start()`. R Server starts the batch execution and assigns an ID to the execution and returns the batch object. 

**Syntax:** `start()`

No arguments.

**Returns:** The batch object

**Example:**
```R
txBatch$start()     
```

>[!NOTE]
> We recommend you always use the `id` function after you start the execution so that you can find it easily with this id later such as: 
> `txBatch$start()$id()`

<a name="id-fx"></a>

### Get batch ID
Get the batch task's identifier to reference during or after its execution using `id()`. 

**Syntax:** `id()`

No arguments.

**Returns:** The ID for the named batch object.

**Example:**
```R
txBatch$id()    
```

<a name="findbatch-fx"></a>
### Get batch by ID

**Syntax:** `getBatch(id)`

|Argument|Description|
|----|----|
|`id`|The batch execution identifiers|

**Returns:** The `Batch` object

**Example:**
```R
getBatch(id)
```

<a name="listids-fx"></a>

### List the Batch execution identifiers

**Syntax:** `getBatchExecutions()`

No arguments

**Returns:** List of batch execution identifiers

**Example:**
```R
getBatchExecutions()
```

<a name="cancel-fx"></a>

### Cancel execution
Cancel the batch execution using `cancel()`.

**Syntax:** `cancel()`

No arguments.

**Returns:** The batch object

**Example:**
```R
txBatch$cancel()     
```


## 4. Monitor, retrieve, and interact with results

While the batch task is running, you can monitor and poll the results. Once the batch task has completed, you can get the web service consumption output by index from the batch results object, including:
+ Get a list of every file that was generated by this execution index
+ See the file contents of a specific file or every file returned
+ Download files from execution index  
+ Get results for a given index row returned as an array 

<a name="results-fx"></a>

### Monitor and get execution results
There are several public functions you can use to get the results and status of a batch execution.

+ Monitor or get the batch execution results
  + **Syntax:** `results(partialResults = TRUE)`
    |Argument|Description|
    |----|----|
    |`partialResults`|This argument returns the already processed results of the batch execution even if it has not been fully completed. If `partialResults = FALSE`, then it will only return the results if the execution has completed.|
  + **Returns:** A batch result object is returned, which in our example is called `batchRes`. 

+ Get the status of the batch execution. 
  + **Syntax:** `STATUS`
    no arguments
  + **Returns:** The status of the batch execution. 

**Example:**
In this example, we  monitor the results, return partial results every three seconds until the batch execution fails or completes, and then return results for a given index row returned as an array:
```R
batchRes <- NULL
while(TRUE) {
   # Send any results, including partial results, for txBatch task
   # Assign it to the batch result variable batchRes: 
   batchRes <- txBatch$results(partialResult = TRUE)

   # Check STATUS of the task
   if (batchRes$status == txBatch$STATUS$failed) { stop("Batch execution failed") } 
   if (batchRes$status == txBatch$STATUS$complete) { break }

   # Repeat check every 3 seconds   
   Sys.sleep(3)
}
```


<a name="exe-fx"></a>

### Get execution results as an array

Get the execution results for a given index row.

**Syntax:** `execution(index)`

|Argument|Description|
|----|----|
|`index`|Index value for a given batch data record|

**Returns:** The execution results for a given index row as an array. 

**Example:**
In this example, we  monitor the results, return partial results every three seconds until the batch execution fails or completes, and then return results for a given index row returned as an array:
```R
# In a loop, get results for a given index row returned as an array in a loop
# assign it to 'exe' and output a data frame for each row.
for(i in seq(batchRes$totalItemCount)) {
   exe <- batchRes$execution(i)
   singleRowDataFrame <- exe$outputParameters$output
}
```
<a name="listfiles-fx"></a>

### Get list of generated files

Retrieve a list of every file that was generated during the batch execution for a given data record, or index, with `listFiles()`. This can be made part of a loop to get the list of the files for every data record (see workflow example for a loop). 

**Syntax:** `listFiles(index)`

|Argument|Description|
|----|----|
|`index`|Index value for a given batch data record|

**Returns:** A list of every file that was generated during the batch execution for a given data record

**Example:**
```R
files <- txBatch$listFiles(i)     
```

<a name="fileContent-fx"></a>

### Display file contents

Display the file contents of a named file returned in the above list with `fileContent()`. R Server returns the ID for the named batch object. 

**Syntax:** `fileContent(index, fileName)`

|Argument|Description|
|----|----|
|`index`|Index value for a given batch data record|
|`fileName`|Name of file artifact created during batch execution|

**Returns:** The ID for the named batch object

**Example:**
```R
for(i in seq(batchRes$totalItemCount)) {
       for (fileName in files) {
          content <- txBatch$fileContent(i, fileName)
          if (is.null(content)) { stop("Unable to get file") }
       }
}       
```
<a name="download-fx"></a>

### Download generated files 

Download the file(s) from a specific execution index using `download()`. By default, files are downloaded to the current working directory `getwd()` unless a different `dest = "<path>"` is specified. You can choose to download a specific file or all files. 

**Syntax:** `download(index, fileName, dest = "<path>")`

|Argument|Description|
|----|----|
|`index`|Index value for a given batch data record|
|`fileName`|Name of specific file generated during batch execution. If omitted, all files are downloaded for that index.|
|`dest`|The download directory on your local machine. The default is the current R working directory. The directory must already exist on the local machine.|

**Returns:** The path to each downloaded file. 

**Example:**

In this example, we download a named file for the 5th index to a specified directory, and then download all files to the default working directory.

```R
#Download a named file for 5th index to the specified directory
txBatch$download(5, "HistogramFile.png", dest = "C:/bgates/batchfiles/")

# Download all files for a given index to the default current R working directory in a loop
for(i in seq(batchRes$totalItemCount)) {
  txBatch$download(i)
}
```
