# Get Started for Data Scientists

Now that you've learned about [R Server's operationalization feature](about.md), we can dig into how data scientists can deploy,  consume, and share web services in order to operationalize their R analytics.

Data scientists work locally with [Microsoft R Client](../r-client-get-started.md) in their preferred R IDE and favorite version control tools to build scripts and models. Using the `mrsdeploy` package that ships with Microsoft R Client and R Server, the data scientist can develop, test, and ultimately deploy these R analytics as web services in your production environment. 

An R Server web service is an R code execution on the [operationalization compute node](configuration-initial.md). Each web service is uniquely defined by a `name` and `version`. You can use the functions in [the `mrsdeploy` package](../mrsdeploy/mrsdeploy.md) to gain access a service's lifecycle from an R script. This package is installed with Microsoft R Client as well as Microsoft R Server.  The `mrsdeploy` package provides functions for publishing and managing a web service backed by an R code block or script that you provide. The package also provides functions for establishing a [remote execution](remote-execution.md) session in a console application.  [Learn more about this package](../mrsdeploy/mrsdeploy.md). Similarly, a set of [RESTful APIs](https://microsoft.github.io/deployr-api-docs/9.0.1/#services-management-apis) are available to provide direct programmatic access to a service's lifecycle directly. 

Once deployed, the web service can be: 
+ [Consumed directly in R by another data scientist](#data-scientists-share), for testing purposes for example 
+ [Integrated into an application by an application developer](app-developer-get-started.md)  using the  Swagger-based .JSON file produced when the web service was published.

## What you'll need

You'll develop your R analytics locally with R Client, deploy them to Microsoft R Server as web services, and then consume or share them.

**On the local client**, you'll need to [install R Client](../r-client-get-started.md) first.  You'll also need to [configure the R IDE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-r/r-client-get-started#step-2-configure-your-ide) of your choice, such as R Tools for Visual Studio, to run Microsoft R Client.  Once you have this set up, you can develop your R analytics in your local R IDE using the functions in [the `mrsdeploy` package](../mrsdeploy/mrsdeploy.md) that was installed with Microsoft R Client (and R Server). 

**On the remote server**, you'll need the connection details and access to an instance of [Microsoft R Server](../rserver.md) with its [operationalization feature configured](configuration-initial.md). Once R Server is configured for operationalization, you'll be able to [connect to it from your local machine](../operationalize/mrsdeploy-connection.md), deploy your models and other analytics to Microsoft R Server as web services, and finally consume or share those services. Please contact your administrator for any missing connection details.

## How to deploy a model as a service

This example walks you through the deployment of a simple model as a web service hosted in R Server. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This example assumes you have configured an R Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to work with [Microsoft R Client](../r-client-get-started.md). It also assumes you have [authenticated access](security-authentication.md) to an instance of Microsoft R Server with its [operationalization feature configured](configuration-initial.md).


We'll use the following script in our example:

```R

swagger <- api$swagger()
cat(swagger, file = "swagger.json", append = FALSE)

# Share Swagger-based JSON with those who need to consume it
```

Now let's dive into this example down. Let's start by creating the model locally, then publish it, and then share it with other authenticated users.

### A. Model locally

1. Launch your R IDE. 

   <!--@In our example, we are using R Tools | Visual Studio (RTVS), but any popular R IDE should work.-->
   
   <!--@SCREEN [RTVS with R Client installed]-->

1. Run the R code to create the model.  

   In our example, the GLM model, `carsModel`, is creating using the dataset `mtcars`, which is a built-in data frame in R. This model estimates the probability of a vehicle being fitted with a manual transmission base on horsepower (hp) and weight (wt)

   ```R
   # Create glm model with `mtcars` dataset
   carsModel <- glm(formula = am ~ hp + wt, data = mtcars, family = binomial)

   # Wrap prediction in a function
   manualTransmission <- function(hp, wt) {
     newdata <- data.frame(hp = hp, wt = wt)
     predict(carsModel, newdata, type = "response")
   }
   
   # test function by printing results
   print(manualTransmission(120, 2.8)) # 0.6418125
   ```

1. Examine the results of the locally executed code. 

   <!--In this example, the results show @.-->
   
   <!--@SCREEN [RTVS SHOWING RESULTS]-->

<br> 

### B. Publish model as a web service

1. From your local R IDE, log into Microsoft R Server **with your credentials** using the appropriate authentication function from [the `mrsdeploy` package](../operationalize/mrsdeploy-connection.md) (`remoteLogin` or `remoteLoginAAD`).  

   Learn more about the authentication functions and their arguments in the article: ["Connecting to R Server from mrsdeploy"](../operationalize/mrsdeploy-connection.md).

   In our example, we used Azure Active Directory for authentication with the `remoteLoginAAD` function and `session = false` so that no remote R session is started.

   ```R  
   remoteLoginAAD(
       "https://rserver.contoso.com:12800", 
       authuri = "https://login.windows.net", 
       tenantid = "microsoft.com", 
       clientid = "5599bff3-2ec2-4975-9068-28acf86a3b6f", 
       resource = "b9667d00-1c06-4b9d-a94f-06ecb71822b0", 
       session = FALSE 
   )
   ``` 

   <!--@SCREEN [RTVS PROOF OF SUCCESSFUL CONNECTION TO MRS.]-->

   Now, you are successfully connected to the remote R Server.

1. Publish the model as a web service to R Server using [the `publishService()` function](../mrsdeploy/mrsdeploy-websrv-vignette.md) from the `mrsdeploy` package.

   To publish it, you'll need to specify:
   + A name for the service (required)
   + The code (required) and necessary model assets 
   + Any inputs 
   + The output that application developers will need to integrate in their applications. 
   + A unique version number for the service, if you'll be sharing it with others.   

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >In the case where you are working with a [remote R session](remote-execution.md) and you want to publish a web service, do so in your local session. If you try to publish remotely, you'll get this message: `Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(uri, handle = h) : URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL`. Instead, use the remote execution function `pause()` to return the R command line in your local session, publish your service, and then use the `resume()` function to continue running R code from the remote command line in the remote R session.

   In this example, we executed these commands to publish a web service (`"mtService"`) using a model (`carsModel`) and a function (`manualTransmission`). As an input, it takes a list of vehicle horsepower and vehicle weight represented as an R numerical. As an output, a percentage as an R numeric for the probability each vehicle has ofÂ being fitted with a manual transmission. 

   ```R
   api <- publishService(
     "mtService",
     code = manualTransmission,
     model = carsModel,
     inputs = list(hp = "numeric", wt = "numeric"),
     outputs = list(answer = "numeric"),
     v = "v1.0.0"
   )
   ```

<br> 

### C. Consume the new service in R to test it

Consume the service in R directly after publishing it to verify that the results are as expected.

```R
# Print capabilities that define the service holdings: service 
# name, version, descriptions, inputs, outputs, and the 
# name of the function to be consumed
print(api$capabilities())
   
# Consume service by calling function, `manualTransmission`
# contained in this service
result <- api$manualTransmission(120, 2.8)

# Print response output named `answer`
print(result$output("answer")) # 0.6418125   

``` 

In our example, we observe the same results as we did when it was locally executed.

>[!NOTE]
>As long as the package versions are the same on R Server as they are locally, you should get the same results. You can check for differences using [a remote session "diff report"](remote-execution.md#diff). 

### D. Get the Swagger-based JSON file

During the authenticated session in which you published the service, you can download the Swagger-based JSON file specific to this service so that you or other authenticated users can test and consume the service. This Swagger-based JSON file is generated when the service was published. It will be downloaded to the local file system. 

In this example, we executed these commands to download the Swagger-based JSON file:

```R
swagger <- api$swagger()
cat(swagger, file = "swagger.json", append = FALSE) 
``` 

>[!NOTE]
>See [the next section](#share) for the code to get this Swagger-based JSON file after the session ends.
   
<br> 

<a name="share"></a>

## How to share a service with others 

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Anyone who wishes to consume the service must have [authenticated access](security-authentication.md) to an instance of Microsoft R Server with its [operationalization feature configured](configuration-initial.md).

When the web service is published, a Swagger-based JSON file is generated automatically to define the service. You can now hand off this file to share the predictive web service with **other authenticated users of R Server**, such as:

Data scientists can also explore and consume Web services directly in R using some of the functions in the `mrsdeploy` package installed with Microsoft R Server and R Client. 

<a name="data-scientists-share"></a>

### Collaborate with data scientists

Other data scientist may want to explore, test, and consume Web services directly in R using the functions in the `mrsdeploy` package installed with Microsoft R Server and R Client. 

As the owner of the service, you can share the name and version number for the service with fellow data scientists so they can call the service in R using the functions in the `mrsdeploy` package.  After authenticating, data scientists can use the `getService` function in R to call the service. Then, they can get details about the service and start consuming it.

```R
# Get service using `getService()` function from `mrsdeploy` package.
# Assign service to the variable `api`.
api <- getService("mtService",Â "v1.0.0")

# Print capabilities to see what service can do.
print(api$capabilities())
     
# Start interacting with the service, for example:
# Calling the function, `manualTransmission`
# contained in this service.
result <- api$manualTransmission(120, 2.8)

# Since you're authenticated, get this service's `swagger.json`.
swagger <- api$swagger()
cat(swagger, file = "swagger.json", append = FALSE)
```

<a name="swagger-app-dev"></a>

### Collaborate with application developers

Application developers can call and integrate web services into their applications using each service-specific Swagger-based JSON file along with the required inputs. 

Once the application developer has this Swagger-based JSON file, he or she can create client libraries for integration. Read "[Application Developer Get Started Guide](app-developer-get-started.md)" for more details.  
   
Get the Swagger-based JSON file in one of two ways:

+ A data scientist can send them the Swagger-based JSON file they've downloaded, which can sometimes be a faster approach. In R, you can get the file with the following code and send it to the application developer:
   ```R
   api <- getService("<name>",Â "<version>")
   swagger <- api$swagger()
   cat(swagger, file = "swagger.json", append = FALSE) 
   ```

+ Or, the application developer can request the file  **as an authenticated user with an [active bearer token](app-developer-get-started.md#authentication) in the request header** (since all API calls must be authenticated). The URL is formed as follows:
  ```
  GET /api/<service-name>/<service-version>/swagger.json
  ```

<!--## Example: Deploy an R script as a service-->

## How to execute R code remotely

You can use Microsoft R Client to run your R code locally and from R Client you can connect remotely to R Server to run your code there. You can easily switch between the local context and the remote context using `pause()` and `resume()` functions.  Learn more in this article, [Remote Execution in Microsoft R Server](remote-execution.md).

Requirements for remote execution include:

+ You must configure an R Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to work with [Microsoft R Client](../r-client-get-started.md). 
+ You must also have [authenticated access](security-authentication.md) to an instance of Microsoft R Server with its [operationalization feature configured](configuration-initial.md).
