# About Operationalization with R Server

You can configure R Server to be the operationalization engine of your advanced R analytics.

With operationalization enabled, R Server offers:

+ Instant deployment and easy consumption of your R analytics
+ "Write once / deploy anywhere" - no more duplication of efforts
+ Speedy real-time and batch scoring
+ [Scalability](configuration-initial.md) for more power and better load balancing
+ [Diagnostic](admin-utility.md#test) and [capacity evaluation](admin-utility.md#capacity) tools
+ Enterprise grade security: [SSL](security-https.md) and [authentication with AD LDAP or Azure AD](security-authentication.md).

With this release of Microsoft R, we now offer an improved version of the operationalization engine for all  your analytics. Regardless of the source, language or method, you can simplify, deploy, and realize the promise and power of advanced analytics.
