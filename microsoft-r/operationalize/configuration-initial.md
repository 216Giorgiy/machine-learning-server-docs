# Configuring R Server for Operationalization

To benefit from Microsoft R Serverâ€™s deployment and operationalization features, you can configure R Server after installation to act as a deployment server and host analytic web services.

The simplest configuration for this feature involves a single web node and compute node, called a **one-box** configuration. These components are defined as follows:

+ A **web node** acts as a HTTP REST endpoint with which users can interact directly to make API calls. It can also access data in the database, and send jobs to the compute node. 

+ A **compute node** is used to execute R code as a session or service. Each compute node has its own pool of R shells.
The size is in the compute node configuration:
"Pool": {
    "InitialSize": 5,
    "MaxSize": 80
  },
 
The pool starts in initial size and grows until max size if there are more requests.
 

In addition to the one-box configuration, you can also install multiple components on multiple machines, which is referred to as an  **enterprise** configuration.

## The Basic One-Box Configuration

With one-box configurations, as the name suggests, everything runs on a single machine and set-up is a breeze. This configuration includes an operationalization web node and compute node on the same machine. It also relies on the default local SQLite database.

This configuration is useful when you want to explore what it is to operationalize R analytics using R Server. It is perfect for testing, proof-of-concepts, and small-scale prototyping, but might not be appropriate for production usage.

**To configure on a single machine:**

1. On each machine, install Microsoft R Server:

     + On Windows, install [R Server (Standalone)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt671127.aspx)

     + On Linux, install [Microsoft R Server](../rserver-install-linux-server.md).  

1. [Launch the administration utility](admin-utility.md#launch) with administrator, `root`, or `sudo` privileges.

1. Choose the option to **Configure R Server for Operationalization**.

1. Choose the option to **Configure for one box** to set up the web node and compute node onto the same machine.

1. When prompted, provide a password for the built-in, local operationalization `admin` account. 

1. Return to the main menu of the utility when the configuration ends. 

1. [Run a diagnostic test of the configuration](admin-utility.md#test). 
  
1. On Linux: If using the IPTABLES firewall or equivalent service on Linux, use the `iptables` command (or the equivalent) to open port 12800 to the public IP of the web node so that remote machines can access it. 


You are now ready to begin operationalizating your R analytics with R Server.

## The Enterprise Configuration

With an enterprise configuration, you can work with your production-grade data within a scalable, multi-machine setup, and benefit from enterprise-grade security. 

This configuration includes one or more web nodes and compute nodes on a group of machines, which can be scaled independently. Scaling up compute nodes will improve throughput. For added security, you can authenticate against [Active Directory (LDAP) or Azure Active Directory](security-authentication.md) and [configure SSL](security-https.md).

Additionally, when you have multiple web nodes, you must set up a [remote SQL Server or PostgreSQL database](configure-remote-database.md) so that data can be shared across web node services.

**Step 1: Configure web node(s)**

>**Note:** It is possible to run the operationalization web node service from within IIS.

  1. On each machine, install Microsoft R Server:

     + On Windows, install [R Server (Standalone)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt671127.aspx). 
     + On Linux, install [Microsoft R Server](../rserver-install-linux-server.md).  

  1. [Launch the administration utility](admin-utility.md#launch) with administrator privileges:
     1. From the main menu, choose the option to **Configure R Server for Operationalization**.
     1. From the sub-menu, choose the option to **Configure a web node**.     
     1. When prompted, provide a password for the built-in, local operationalization `admin` account.  
        You can always authenticate against  [Active Directory (LDAP) or Azure Active Directory](security-authentication.md) later.
  
  1. On Linux: If using the IPTABLES firewall or equivalent service on Linux, use the `iptables` command (or the equivalent) to open port 12800 to the public IP of the web node so that remote machines can access it. 

Your web node is now configured. Repeat these steps for each web node you want to add.

<a name="add-compute-nodes"></a>

**Step 2: Configure Compute Node(s)**

>**Note:** A compute node can be configured on its own machine or on the same machine as the web node.

1. On each machine, install the same R Server version you installed on the web node.

1. [Launch the administration utility](admin-utility.md#launch) with administrator privileges.

1. From the main menu, choose the option to **Configure R Server for Operationalization**.

1. From the sub-menu, choose the option to **Configure a compute node**.
  
Your compute node is now configured. Repeat these steps for each compute node you want to add.

**Step 3: Configure Enterprise-Grade Security**

In production environments, we strongly recommend the following approaches:

1. [Configure SSL](security-https.md) and install the necessary certificates. 

1. Authenticate against [Active Directory (LDAP) or Azure Active Directory](security-authentication.md).  

1. For added security, restrict the list of IPs that can access the machine hosting the compute node.

**Step 4: Configure a Remote Database**

By default, the web node configuration sets up a SQLite database. If you have multiple web nodes or simply want to use a remote database, follow these instructions to [configure remote database](configure-remote-database.md) (SQL Server or PostgreSQL) so that data can be shared across web node services.

**Step 5: Provisioning on the Cloud**

If provisioning on a cloud service, then you must also [create inbound security rule for port 12800 in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-classic-setup-endpoints/) or open the port through the AWS console.

**Step 6: Post Configuration**

Once all web nodes and compute nodes are configured, you must declare the IP addresses of each compute node with each web node.

1. Open `<MRS_home>\deployr\Microsoft.DeployR.Server.WebAPI\appsettings.json` where `<MRS_home>` is the path to the Microsoft R Server install directory. To find this path, enter `normalizePath(R.home())` in your R console.
1. In the file, search for the section starting with `"BackEndConfiguration": {` .
1. Uncomment characters in that section.
1. Update the `"Uris": {` properties to declare each backend:
   ```
    "Uris": {
      "Description": "Update 'Values' section to point to your backend machines. Using HTTPS is highly recommended",
      "Values": [
        "http://<IP-ADDRESS-OF-BACKEND-1>:12805",
        "http://<IP-ADDRESS-OF-BACKEND-2>:12805",
        "http://<IP-ADDRESS-OF-BACKEND-3>:12805"       
      ]
    }
    ```

1. Close and save the file.
1. Launch the administrator's utility and [restart the compute node](admin-utility.md#startstop).
1. Verify the configuration by running [diagnostic test](admin-utility.md#test) on each web node. 
1. Repeat these steps on each web node to declare all the backends.
