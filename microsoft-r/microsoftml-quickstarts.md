# Quickstarts for MicrosoftML

Samples are described and linked here to help you get started quickly using MicrosoftML.

## Breast cancer prediction using rxFastLinear

This starter [breast cancer prediction sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-r/tree/master/microsoft-ml/Samples/101/BinaryClassification/BreastCancerPrediction) builds a model to predict breast cancer. It uses the well known Breast Cancer UCI dataset with [`rxFastLinear`]() algorithm provided by the MicrosoftML package.

The type of machine learning task exhibited in this sample is a binary classification problem. Specifically, a given set of cell mass characteristics is used to predict whether the mass is benign or malignant.

## Sentiment analysis

TBD

## Image featurization

TBD

## Run an ML analysis on an Azure Spark cluster
