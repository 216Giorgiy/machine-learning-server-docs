# Welcome to Machine Learning Server

Machine Learning Server is an enterprise class server for custom machine learning solutions written in Python and R. It runs on premises on [supported platforms](install/r-server-install-supported-platforms.md). You can also run it in the cloud on Azure virtual machines, or access its function libraries through Azure HDInsight.

Scripts and code can be written in Python or R, calling functions from open source packages, proprietary packages from Microsoft, and third-party packages. Our propriety packages offer comprehensive, high performance function libraries for data manipulation and transformation, creating and training models, scoring data, visualizing and analyzing results.

R support is mature, built on a legacy of Microsoft R Server and former Revolution R Enterprise products. Python support is new in this first release of Machine Learning Server. 

## Inside Machine Larning Server

+ R packages
+ Python modules
+ Pretrained models ready to score data you provide
+ Open source distributions of R and Python
+ Interpreters and libraries for running script
