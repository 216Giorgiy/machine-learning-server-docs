# Welcome to Machine Learning Server

Machine Learning Server is your flexible choice for analyzing data at scale, building intelligent apps, and discovering valuable insights across your business.  

Machine Learning Server includes a collection of packages, interpreters, and infrastructure for developing and deploying R and Python-based machine learning and data science solutions on a [range of platforms](install/r-server-install-supported-platforms.md), from standalone installs on Linux and Windows, to large distributed deployments on node clusters. 

R support is built on a legacy of Microsoft R Server 9.1 and former Revolution R Enterprise products. Python support is new in this first release of Machine Learning Server. 

## Inside Machine Learning Server

+ [R packages](r-reference/introducing-r-server-r-package-reference.md)
+ [Python modules](python-reference/introducing-python-package-reference.md)
+ [Pretrained models](install/microsoftml-install-pretrained-models.md) for visual analysis and text sentiment analysis, ready to score data you provide
+ Open source distributions of R and Python
+ Interpreters and run time infrastructure for script execution
+ [Analytic deployment and consumption](operationalize/concept-operationalize-deploy-consume.md)
+ [Remote execution](r/how-to-execute-code-remotely.md)
+ Clustered topologies for [Spark and Hadoop MapReduce](install/machine-learning-server-hadoop-install.md), and Windows or Linux using the [operationalization capability](operationalize/configure-start-for-administrators) built into Machine Learning Server

## Next steps

Install Machine Learning Server on a supported platform. 

Choose a quickstart to test-drive capabilities in ten minutes or less.

Move on to tutorials for in-depth exploration.

> [!Note]
> You can use any R or Python IDE to write code using libraries from Machine Learning Server. Microsoft offers Python for Visual Studio and R for Visual Studio. To use Jupyter Notebook, see [How to configure Jupyter Noteboooks](python/howto-revoscalepy-jupyter-nb-config.md).
