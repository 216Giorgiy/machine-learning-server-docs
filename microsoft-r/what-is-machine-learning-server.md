# Welcome to Machine Learning Server

Microsoft Machine Learning Server is your flexible enterprise platform for analyzing data at scale, building intelligent apps, and discovering valuable insights across your business.  

Machine Learning Server includes a collection of packages, interpreters, and infrastructure for developing and deploying R and Python-based machine learning and data science solutions on a [range of platforms](install/r-server-install-supported-platforms.md), from standalone installs on Linux and Windows to large distributed deployments on node clusters. With these custom R and Python packages, Machine Learning Server brings the best of open source and proprietary innovation together. 

R support is built on a legacy of Microsoft R Server 9.x and Revolution R Enterprise products. Significant machine learning and AI capabilities enhancements have been made in every release. In 9.2.1, Machine Learning Server adds support for the full data science lifecycle of your Python-based analytics. 

Additionally, through its operationalization feature, you deploy your models to an scalable grid for both batch and real-time scoring.

## Inside Machine Learning Server

| Feature category | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| R support | [R packages](r-reference/introducing-r-server-r-package-reference.md) for solutions written in R, with an open source distribution of R and run-time infrastructure for script execution. |
| Python support | [Python modules](python-reference/introducing-python-package-reference.md) for solutions written in Python,  with an open source distribution of Python and run-time infrastructure for script execution.  
| [Pre-trained models](install/microsoftml-install-pretrained-models.md) | For visual analysis and text sentiment analysis, ready to score data you provide. |
| [Deploy and consume](what-is-operationalization.md) | Operationalize your server and deploy solutions as a web service. |
| [Remote execution](r/how-to-execute-code-remotely.md) | Start remote sessions on a Machine Learning Server on your network from your client workstation. |
| Scale-out on premises | Clustered topologies for [Spark and Hadoop MapReduce](install/machine-learning-server-hadoop-install.md), and Windows or Linux using the [operationalization capability](operationalize/configure-start-for-administrators.md) built into Machine Learning Server. |

For feature descriptions in this release, see [What's New in Machine Learning Server](whats-new-in-machine-learning-server.md).

## Next steps

[Install Machine Learning Server](install/machine-learning-server-install.md) on a supported platform. 

[Choose a quickstart](index.yml) to test-drive capabilities in ten minutes or less. Move on to tutorials for in-depth exploration.

> [!Note]
> You can use any R or Python IDE to write code using libraries from Machine Learning Server. Microsoft offers Python for Visual Studio and R for Visual Studio. To use Jupyter Notebook, see [How to configure Jupyter Noteboooks](python/how-to-revoscalepy-jupyter-nb-config.md).
