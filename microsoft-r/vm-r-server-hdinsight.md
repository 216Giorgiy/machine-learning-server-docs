# Introducing R Server on HDInsight

Running Microsoft R Server as a service on top of HDInsight, R Server for HDInsight achieves unprecedented scale and performance by combining enterprise-scale R analytics software with the power of Hadoop and Spark. Multi-threaded math libraries and transparent parallelization in R Server means handling up to 1000x more data and up to 50x faster speeds than open source Râ€”helping you train more accurate models for better predictions than previously possible. Plus, because R Server is built to work with the open source R language, all of your R scripts can run without changes.
