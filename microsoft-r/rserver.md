# Introducing Microsoft R Server

[!include[Microsoft R Server](./includes/r-server/intro.md)]

Get started by reading this [Getting Started](microsoft-r-getting-started.md) guide.

While the tutorials in the Getting Started guide have given you the basic tools to begin exploring, you may still want more guidance for your specific tasks. Luckily, there is a huge library of Microsoft R, open-source R, and S documentation that can help you perform almost any task with R. The obvious place to start is with the rest of the **Microsoft R** document set, which includes documentation on the **RevoScaleR** package for scalable data analysis (on all platforms). You can find this documentation on this site using the table of contents on this page.

Next, you should be aware of the R Core Team manuals, which are part of every R distribution, including *An Introduction to R*, *The R Language Definition*, *Writing R Extensions* and so on. Beyond the standard R manuals, there are many other resources. [Learn about them here](microsoft-r-more-resources.md).
