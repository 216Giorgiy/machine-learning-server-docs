# About pre-trained machine learning models 

Pre-trained deep neural network models for sentiment analysis and image featurization are available to use with MicrosoftML R package and the microsoftml python package. These models require large databases and are time-consuming to train. Using pre-trained models allow users to efficiently extract relevant features from text and images.

They can be installed as an optional component of the **Microsoft Machine Learning**, **SQL Server Machine Learning Services**, **Microsoft R Server** products. They are also available with the local tools for Python and  **Microsoft R Client**. For a list of these platforms, see the [Platform availability](../r/concept-what-is-the-microsoftml-package.md#platform-availability) section.

For quickstarts that show how to use pretrained models for sentiment analysis and image featurization, see [Quickstarts for MicrosoftML](../r/sample-microsoftml.md).
