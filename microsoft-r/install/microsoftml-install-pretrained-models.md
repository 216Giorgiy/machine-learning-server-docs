# Pre-trained machine learning models for sentiment analysis and image detection

Pre-trained deep neural network models for sentiment analysis of unstructured raw text and image featurization are available to use with [MicrosoftML R package](../r-reference/microsoftml/microsoftml-package.md) and the [microsoftml Python package](../python-reference/microsoftml/microsoftml-package.md). We offer pre-trained models that can be used to score content you provide. 

Pre-trained models are installed as:

+ an optional component of the **Machine Learning Server** or **SQL Server Machine Learning Services**. 
+ with local tools for Python and  **Microsoft R Client**. 

For samples showing how to use pretrained models for sentiment analysis and image featurization, see [Samples for MicrosoftML](../r/sample-microsoftml.md).

## Next steps

Install the models by running the setup program or script for the platform you are using.
