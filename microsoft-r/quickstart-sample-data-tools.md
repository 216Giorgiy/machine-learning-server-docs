# Quick start: Get ready with tools and sample data

Prepare to learn and explore using a development environment and sample airline data set used in many Microsoft R tutorials and function reference examples.

You can use R Studio or R Tools for Visual Studio (RTVS). This tutorial assumes RTVS, which is built into Visual Studio 2017 with no additional installation. If you used RTVS from a previous version of Visual Studio, the RTVS component is installed as an add-in.

Sample data is included in installations of Microsoft R Client and Microsoft R Server (MRS). We introduce you to small and large datasets so that you are ready to step into almost any tutorial we offer.

## Prerequisites

One of the following:

+ R Server developer edition on a Cloudera VM

+ R Server (developer or enterprise) on any platform

+ R Client on Windows
