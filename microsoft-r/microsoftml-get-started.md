# How to get started with MicrosoftML

**MicrosoftML** is a package for **Microsoft R Server** and **Microsoft R Client** that adds state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and data transforms to Microsoft R Server and Client functionality. The new machine learning functionality provides increased speed, performance and scalability, especially for handling a large corpus of text data or high-dimensional categorical data. It enables you to run these functions locally on Windows or Linux machines or on Azure HDInsight (Hadoop/Spark) clusters. For a conceptual overview of the machine learning transforms and algorithms in MicrosoftML, see [MicrosoftML functions](overview-microsoftml-functions.md).

Pretrained models for sentiment analysis and image featurization can also be installed and deployed with the  MicrosoftML package. For more information on the pretrained models and samples, see [Quickstart samples for MicrosoftML](microsoftml-quickstarts.md).

## Installation and platform availability

MicrosoftML is installed as part of **Microsoft R Server 9.1.0 and 9.0.1**, **Microsoft R Client 9.1.0 and 9.0.1** and in the **SQL Server Machine Learning Services CTP2** on various platforms. For information on the supported platforms, see [Supported Platforms for Microsoft R Server](rserver-install-supported-platforms.md).

To install pretrained machine learning models for sentiment analysis and image featurization, you must opt-in during setup. For details, see [How to install and deploy pretrained machine learning models with MicrosoftML](deploy-pretrained-microsoftml-models.md).
