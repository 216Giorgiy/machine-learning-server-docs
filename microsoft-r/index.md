#Microsoft R

R is the world’s most powerful, and preferred, programming language for statistical computing, machine learning, and graphics, and is supported by a thriving global community of users, developers, and contributors. Developers frequently provide tools incorporating their expertise in the form of R packages. Traditionally, using R in an enterprise setting has presented certain challenges, especially as the volume of data rises, or when faced with a need to deploy solutions to production environments. 

The Microsoft R product family includes:

+ <a href="#mrc">Microsoft R Client</a>
+ <a href="#mro">Microsoft R Open</a>
+ <a href="#sqlr">SQL Server R Services</a>

To learn about the difference between these Microsoft R products, see the [comparison here](#compare-prods).

##Microsoft R Server

Microsoft R Server is the most broadly deployable enterprise-class analytics platform for R available today. Supporting a variety of big data statistics, predictive modeling and machine learning capabilities, R Server supports the full range of analytics – exploration, analysis, visualization and modeling based on open source R. 

By using and extending open source R, Microsoft R Server is fully compatible with R scripts, functions and CRAN packages, to analyze data at enterprise scale. We also address the in-memory limitations of open source R by adding parallel and chunked processing of data in Microsoft R Server, enabling users to run analytics on data much bigger than what fits in main memory. And since R Server is built on top of Microsoft R Open, you can use any open source R packages to build your analytics. 

Microsoft R Server delivers enterprise class performance and scalability for your R-based applications with libraries that allow you to write once and deploy across multiple platforms with minimal effort, whether on-premises or in the cloud.
