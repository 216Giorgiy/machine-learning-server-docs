# Microsoft R Server

Microsoft R Server is the most broadly deployable enterprise-class analytics platform for R available today. Supporting a variety of big data statistics, predictive modeling and machine learning capabilities, R Server supports the full range of analytics â€“ exploration, analysis, visualization and modeling based on open source R. 

By using and extending open source R, Microsoft R Server is fully compatible with R scripts, functions and CRAN packages, to analyze data at enterprise scale. We also address the in-memory limitations of open source R by adding parallel and chunked processing of data in Microsoft R Server, enabling users to run analytics on data much bigger than what fits in main memory.

Microsoft R Server delivers enterprise class performance and scalability for your R-based applications with libraries that allow you to write once and deploy across multiple platforms with minimal effort, whether on-premises or in the cloud.
