# Microsoft R Server

Microsoft R Server is the most broadly deployable enterprise-class analytics platform for R available today. Supporting a variety of big data statistics, predictive modeling and machine learning capabilities, R Server supports the full range of analytics â€“ exploration, analysis, visualization and modeling based on open source R. By using and extending open source R, Microsoft R Server is fully compatible with R scripts, functions and CRAN packages, to analyze data at enterprise scale. We also address the in-memory limitations of open source R by adding parallel and chunked processing of data in Microsoft R Server, enabling users to run analytics on data much bigger than what fits in main memory.
