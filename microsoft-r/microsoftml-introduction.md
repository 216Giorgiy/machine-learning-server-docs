# Introduction to MicrosoftML

**MicrosoftML** is a new package for Microsoft R Server that adds state-of-the-art algorithms and data transforms to Microsoft R Server functionality. Microsoft R is a collection of servers and tools that extend the capabilities of R, making it easier and faster to build and deploy R-based solutions. Microsoft R Server brings you the ability to do parallel and chunked data processing that relax the restrictions on dataset size imposed by in-memory open source R. The **MicrosoftML** package is currently available in **Microsoft R Server for Windows** and in the **SQL Server vNext**.

MicrosoftML adds algorithms and transforms that are used by product teams across Microsoft. This brings new machine learning functionality with increased speed, performance and scalability, especially for handling a large corpus of text data or high-dimensional categorical data.  


## Whatâ€™s new?

MicrosoftML supports new end-to-end scenarios that include new features and functionality. You can now:
-	Create text classification models for problems such as sentiment analysis and support ticket classification.
-	Train deep neural nets with GPU acceleration in order to solve complex problems such as retail image classification and handwriting analysis.
-	Work with high-dimensional categorical data for scenarios like online advertising click-through prediction.
-	Solve many other common machine learning tasks such as churn prediction, loan risk analysis, and demand forecasting using state-or-the-art, fast and accurate algorithms.
- Train models 2x faster than logistic regression with the Fast Linear Algorithm (SDCA).
- Train multilayer custom nets on GPUs up to 8x faster with GPU acceleration for Neural Nets.
- Reduce training time up to 10x while still retaining model accuracy using feature selection.


## Data transforms

The **MicrosoftML package** provides a machine learning transform pipelines that allows you to compose a custom set of transforms that can be applied to your data for featurization before training or testing to facilitate these processes. These include:

- **`concat()`**: creates a single vector-valued column from multiple columns. Combining features of the same type into a vector can significantly speed up training times.
- **`categoricalHash()`**: converts a categorical value into an indicator array using hashing. Useful when the number of categories is large or highly variable
- **`categorical()`**: converts a categorical value into an indicator array using a dictionary. Useful when the number of categories is smaller or fixed.
- **`selectFeatures()`**: selects features from the specified variables using one of the two modes: count or mutual information.
- **`featurizeText()`**: produces a bag of counts of n-grams (sequences of consecutive words) from a given text. It offers language detection, tokenization, stopwords removing, text normalization, feature generation, and term weighting using TF, IDF and TF-IDF.


## Machine learning algorithms

The MicrosoftML package provides fast and scalable machine learning algorithms that enable you to tackle common machine learning tasks such as classification, regression and anomaly detection. These are high-performance algorithms that are multi-threaded, some of which execute off disk, so that they can scale up to to 100s of GBs on a single-node. These include:

## Getting started with MicrosoftML

MicrosoftML is currently available in **Microsoft R Server for Windows** and in the **SQL Server vNext**. For additional information, see [Microsoft R Getting Started Guide](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-r/microsoft-r-getting-started) and [What's New in SQL Server R Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt604847.aspx). MicrosoftML functions are provided through the **MicrosoftML** package which is installed in the freely available [Microsoft R Client](r-client.md) and in the commercial product [Microsoft R Server](rserver.md).
