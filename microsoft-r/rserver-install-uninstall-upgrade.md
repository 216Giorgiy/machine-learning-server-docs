# Uninstall R Server to upgrade to a newer version

This article explains how to uninstall Microsoft R Server on either Linux or Hadoop. Upgrading to any new version of R Server, regardless of whether it's a major or minor release, requires that you first uninstall the existing deployment so that you can install the new distribution.

When you do reinstall R, we recommend [installing R Server 2016 (version 8.0.5)](rserver-install-hadoop-805.md) because it provides the newest features, including significant enhancements to the installers.

## Hadoop considerations for uninstall and reinstallation of R Server

You can uninstall and reinstall node by node across the cluster, but donâ€™t try to submit any jobs until all nodes are at the same functional level.

If you are upgrading the Hadoop cluster, you must uninstall and reinstall Microsoft R Server on the cluster. You can either uninstall R Server before upgrading your cluster, or create and run a user-defined script that repairs the R Server links as a post-upgrade operation. The simpler approach is to uninstall R Server first, upgrade the cluster, and then reinstall R Server.

## Before you uninstall

Uninstall reverses the installation steps, including uninstalling any package dependencies used only by R Server, so the best place to start is by collecting some information about your installation:

- Version of R Server in the cluster
- Package location
- Which nodes in the cluster have R Server

## Program version and file locations

There are several approaches for identifying a program version, including `rpm -qi` as noted in the installation instructions.

- `rpm -qi microsoft-r-server-mro-8.0` (applies to Microsoft R Server 2016, build 8.0.5)
- `rpm -qi MRO-for-MRS-8.0.0` (applies to Microsoft R Server 2016, build 8.0.0)
- `rpm -qi RRO-8.0.3` (applies to Revolution R Server 7.4 and 8.0.3)

Version information is also evident in the file path, indicated in the examples below.

- `/usr/lib64/microsoft-r/8.0` (applies to Microsoft R Server 2016, build 8.0.5)
- `/usr/lib64/MRO-for-MRS` and `/usr/lib64/MRS-8.0` (applies to Microsoft R Server 2016, build 8.0.0)
- `/usr/lib64/RRO-8.0.3` and `usr/lib64/Revo-7.4` (applies to Revolution R Server 7.4 and 8.0.3)

You might see this path, given a Cloudera Manager parcel installation.

- `/opt/cloudera/parcel`

## How to uninstall 8.0.5

Packages are registered in a database that tracks all package installations in the cluster. To update the database, use a package manager to remove the package: **yum** for Red Hat and CentOS, or **zypper** for SUSE.

1. Uninstall the package (use one of the following):

    - `sudo yum erase microsoft-r-server-mro-8.0`
    - `sudo zypper rm microsoft-r-server-mro-8.0`

2. On the root node, verify the location of other files that need to be removed:
        `$ ls /usr/lib64/microsoft-r/8.0`

3. Remove the entire directory:
        `$ rm -fr /usr/lib64/microsoft-r`

RM removes the folder. Parameter "f" is for force and "r" for recursive, deleting everything under microsoft-r. This command is destructive and irrevocable, so be sure you have the correct directory before you press Enter.

## How to uninstall 8.0.0

1. Erase Microsoft R Open:
    `yum erase MRO-for-MRS-8.0.0`
2. Remove directories of MRS and MRO, in this order:
    `rm -rf /usr/lib64/MRS-8.0`
    `rm -rf /usr/lib64/MRO-for-MRS-8.0.0`
3. Remove symlinks:
    `rm -f /usr/bin/Revo64 /usr/bin/Revoscript`

## How to uninstall 7.4

1. Run the uninstall script to remove Revolution R Enterprise and Revolution R Connector:
    `/usr/lib64/Revo-7.4/uninstall_revo.sh`
2. Erase Revolution R Open:
    `yum erase RRO-8.0.3`
3. Remove directories of RRE and RRO, in this order:
     `rm -rf /usr/lib64/Revo-7.4`
     `rm -rf /usr/lib64/RRO-8.0.3`

## How to uninstall individual packages

If you remove Microsoft R Open (microsoft-r-server-mro-8.0-8.0.5-1.x86_64), you will also remove any dependent packages used only by R Open.

Uninstall order is important. Due to package dependencies, be sure to remove the packages in the order given below.

**For RPM**

        $ rpm -e microsoft-r-server-hadoop-8.0-8.0.5-1.x86_64
        $ rpm -e microsoft-r-server-packages-8.0-8.0.5-1.x86_64
        $ rpm -e microsoft-r-server-intel-mkl-8.0-8.0.5-1.x86_64
        $ rpm -e microsoft-r-server-mro-8.0-8.0.5-1.x86_64

**For DEB**

    $ dpkg --remove microsoft-r-server-hadoop-8.0-8.0.5-1.x86_64
    $ dpkg --remove microsoft-r-server-packages-8.0-8.0.5-1.x86_64
    $ dpkg --remove microsoft-r-server-intel-mkl-8.0-8.0.5-1.x86_64
    $ dpkg --remove microsoft-r-server-mro-8.0-8.0.5-1.x86_64

## How to uninstall the Hadoop component

If you are uninstalling R Server 2016 (version 8.0.5), there is a Hadoop component that can be uninstalled independently of other packages in the distribution: `microsoft-r-server-hadoop-8.0-8.0.5-1.x86_64`

For versions prior to 8.0.5, do the following:

- Remove symlinks to libhfs.so and libjvm.so
- Remove scaleR JARs (or symlinks to those JARs) from HADOOP_HOME/lib
