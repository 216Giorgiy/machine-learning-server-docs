# Uninstall R Server to upgrade to a newer version

This article explains how to uninstall Microsoft R Server on Hadoop. Upgrading to any new version of R Server, regardless of whether it's a major or minor release, requires that you first uninstall the existing deployment so that you can install the new distribution.

When you do reinstall R Server, we recommend the latest version of [R Server for Hadoop](rserver-install-hadoop.md).

## Considerations for uninstall and reinstallation of R Server

You can uninstall and reinstall node by node across the cluster, but donâ€™t try to submit any jobs until all nodes are at the same functional level.

If you are upgrading the Hadoop cluster, you must uninstall and reinstall Microsoft R Server on the cluster. You can either uninstall R Server before upgrading your cluster, or create and run a user-defined script that repairs the R Server links as a post-upgrade operation. The simpler approach is to uninstall R Server first, upgrade the cluster, and then reinstall R Server.

## Before you uninstall

Uninstall reverses the installation steps, including uninstalling any package dependencies used only by R Server, so the best place to start is by collecting some information about your installation:

- Version of R Server in the cluster
- Package location
- Which nodes in the cluster have R Server

## Program version and file locations

There are several approaches for identifying a program version, including `rpm -qi` as noted in the installation instructions.

List installed packages and get package names:

- `yum list \*microsoft\*`

You might see a list like this:

- `microsoft-r-open-foreachiterators-3.3.x86_64`
- `microsoft-r-open-mkl-3.3.x86_64`
- `microsoft-r-open-mro-3.3.x86_64`

You can get verbose version information using this syntax:

- `rpm -qi <package-name>`

Alternatively, you might see these paths, given a Cloudera Manager parcel installation.

- `/opt/cloudera/parcels/MRO-8.0.5` and `/opt/cloudera/parcels/MRS-8.0.5` (applies to 8.0.5)
- `/opt/cloudera/parcels/MRO-3.2.2-1` and `/opt/cloudera/parcels/MRS-8.0.0-1` (applies to 8.0)

## General instructions for all versions

Packages are registered in a database that tracks all package installations in the cluster. To update the database, use a package manager to remove the package: **yum** for Red Hat and CentOS, or **zypper** for SUSE.

Log in as root or a user with super user privileges. If you are using `sudo`, precede commands requiring root privileges with `sudo` (for example, `sudo yum erase microsoft-r-open-mro-3.3.x86_64`).

## How to uninstall 9.x

1. Uninstall Microsoft R Open (MRO) and remove any dependent packages used only by MRO:

        sudo yum erase microsoft-r-open-mro-3.3.x86_64

2. Repeat for Microsoft R Server.

3. On the root node, verify the location of other files that need to be removed. You might see 3.3 for MRO and 9.0.1 (or 9.1.0) for R Server:

        ls /usr/lib64/microsoft-r/

4. Remove the entire directory:

        rm -fr /usr/lib64/microsoft-r

RM removes the folder. Parameter "f" is for force and "r" for recursive, deleting everything under microsoft-r. This command is destructive and irrevocable, so be sure you have the correct directory before you press Enter.

## How to uninstall 8.0.5

1. Uninstall Microsoft R Open (MRO) and remove any dependent packages used only by MRO:

        yum erase microsoft-r-server-mro-8.0

2. On the root node, verify the location of other files that need to be removed: `

        ls /usr/lib64/microsoft-r/8.0

3. Remove the entire directory:

        rm -fr /usr/lib64/microsoft-r

RM removes the folder. Parameter "f" is for force and "r" for recursive, deleting everything under microsoft-r. This command is destructive and irrevocable, so be sure you have the correct directory before you press Enter.

## How to uninstall 8.0.0

1. Uninstall the Microsoft R Open for Microsoft R Server (MRO-for-MRS) package:

        yum erase MRO-for-MRS-8.0.0

2. Remove directories of MRS and MRO, in this order:

        rm -rf /usr/lib64/MRS-8.0
        rm -rf /usr/lib64/MRO-for-MRS-8.0.0

3. Remove symlinks:

        rm -f /usr/bin/Revo64 /usr/bin/Revoscript

## How to uninstall individual packages

If you remove Microsoft R Open (microsoft-r-server-mro-8.0-8.0.5-1.x86_64), you will also remove any dependent packages used only by R Open.

Uninstall order is important. Due to package dependencies, be sure to remove the packages in the order given below.

        rpm -e microsoft-r-server-hadoop-8.0-8.0.5-1.x86_64
        rpm -e microsoft-r-server-packages-8.0-8.0.5-1.x86_64
        rpm -e microsoft-r-server-intel-mkl-8.0-8.0.5-1.x86_64
        rpm -e microsoft-r-server-mro-8.0-8.0.5-1.x86_64


## How to uninstall the Hadoop component

If you are uninstalling R Server 9.0.1 or 8.0.5, there is a Hadoop component that can be uninstalled independently of other packages in the distribution:

- `microsoft-r-server-hadoop-9.0.1.x86_64`
- `microsoft-r-server-hadoop-8.0-8.0.5-1.x86_64`

For versions prior to 8.0.5, do the following:

- Remove symlinks to libhfs.so and libjvm.so
- Remove scaleR JARs (or symlinks to those JARs) from HADOOP_HOME/lib
