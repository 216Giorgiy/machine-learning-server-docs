# About Microsoft R Server

**Microsoft R Server** is an enterprise class server for hosting and managing parallel and distributed workloads of R processes on servers (Linux and Windows) and clusters (Hadoop and Apache Spark). As of release 9.2, this product is now known as Machine Learning Server when Python support was added. Learn more about [Machine Learning Server.](index.md)

## Next steps

If you are new to Microsoft R, we recommend starting with R Client and an integrated development environment like R Tools for Visual Studio (RTVS). This configuration is free of charge. It gives you Microsoft R Open with full support of all base R functions so that you can write R-only solutions, but also includes the Microsoft R proprietary packages that run locally on your development computer.

Using just Microsoft R Open and RTVS, you can use the R Core Team manuals that are part of every R distribution to learn how to code in R. Built-in manuals include *An Introduction to R*, *The R Language Definition*, *Writing R Extensions* and more. Beyond the standard R manuals, there are many other resources. [Learn about them here](resources-more.md).

However, because you have R Client, your script can also include functions from Microsoft R packages, including MicrosoftML, olapR, and RevoScaleR. All of these packages are available in both R Client and R Server, but at different levels of capacity.

**Tutorials**
Tutorials in Microsoft R product documentation will help you learn how to use the functions in the proprietary packages:
