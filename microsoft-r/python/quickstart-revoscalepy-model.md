# Python tutorial: Create a logistic regression model using revscalepy

This example demonstrates how you can create a logistic regression model in a local compute context in Machine Learning Server, using an algorithm from the revoscalepy package and built-in sample data. 

The revoscalepy package for Python contains objects, transformations, and algorithms similar to those provided for the [RevoScaleR package](../r-reference/revoscaler/revoscaler.md) for the R language. With revoscalepy, you can write Python script that creates a compute context, moves data between compute contexts, transforms data, and trains predictive models using popular algorithms such as logistic and linear regression, decision trees, and more.
