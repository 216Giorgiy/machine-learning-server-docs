# Python tutorial: Logistic regression on Spark using revscalepy

Placeholder. This walkthrough explains how to do logistic regression using revoscalepy in a Spark compute context. In cases where both MML and revoscalepy overlap, we are advising customers to default to revoscalepy if the compute context is Spark.
